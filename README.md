# Simulation of Some Digital Communications Modulation techniques.
The simulated Modulation techniques are:
- BPSK
- QPSK
- 8PSK
- BFSK
- 16QAM

* The communication channel's noise is additive wide gaussian noise(AWGN)
* All simulations are done on the baseband equivalent system, with no carriers.

# Repository content:
- Matlab code for the five modulation techniques.
- Screenshots of the results of BERs and Constellation of each technique.
- Project requirements and results documentation in form of PDF files.
